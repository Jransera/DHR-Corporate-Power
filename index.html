    Corporate Power

  <h2>
    Maintaining accountability within the digital world.
  </h2>
  
  <h3>
    Introduction
  </h3>
  <p>
  With an ever growing internet, comes the potential for ever growing corporate overstep into the digital world. Blablaa (insert better introduction here). 
  Therefore we sought to find a way to manage this relationship and protect the rights of users while giving clear guidelines to corporations to maintain responsibility (idk add snazzy zinger here test).
  Before we can determine how corporations fit within the digital rights space we have to first set clear definitions for what Power and Corporate Power are. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    What Is Corporate Power?
  </h3>
  <p>
    As we believe that digital rights spawn from the fundamental rights written within the UDHR, we believe that the best basis for our work would be one that focuses on corporate power within this offline space. 
    Thus we chose (insert his first name) Birchall’s 2011 (Check this) Corporate responsibility framework(double check naming convention) as the foundation to our work. 
    In his framework, Birchall states that the definition of power is “The production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate”. 
    (insert some analysis or extra sentences here). He continues his definition of Corporate Power as follows: “The production, by business enterprises, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of individuals to enjoy their human rights.” 
    We can take from this that Corporate Power boils down to how corporations influence and control human rights. (insert some analysis). We have thus taken the framework described by Birchall and have separated it into the following 4 sections.

        The power corporations have over institutions is maintained further once we go online. 
        Yet it is important that we define what these online institutions are. 
        Based on the research we did, we believe the best description of online institutions are
        <strong>1)</strong> Online institutions and the stems that control the internet.
        This means the laws that control the internet and the physical infrastructure that is inplace to run the internet.
        And <strong>2)</strong>governmental institutions that may rely on the internet to function.
        Think of the use of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/understanding-risk-assessment-instruments-in-criminal-justice/#:~:text=Algorithmic%20tools%20are%20in%20widespread,is%20most%20likely%20to%20occur.">algorithms within the justice system</a>.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        
        Now that we have a clear understanding of what institutions look like online, It might become apparent how corporations can abuse their power.
        Some of the most apparent ideas we came up with were:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/isps-spent-235-million-on-lobbying-and-donations-more-than-320000-a-day/">Lobbying to maintain favorable conditions</a></li>
          <li>Framing Damages as merely the Cost of Operation</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/news/2021/07/14/weve-spent-billions-provide-broadband-rural-areas-what-failed-wisconsin/7145014002/">Privatization of Government contracts</a></li>
          <li>Use of algorithms in institutions (justice system, foster care)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>
				While these may already seem bad from a birds eye view,
				we believe that each of these also violate one of the rights either found in the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights)  or in the proposed in the EDDR (European Declaration of Digital Rights).
				For example, privatization of government contracts  may impede on the
				<u>Right to Free-Will</u>,by not allowing users to choose their providers or services to the fullest extent.
				Or the non-protection against algorithmic biases infringes on an individual’s 
				<u>Right to Non-Discrimination</u>, as seen in our section about the online Individual.
