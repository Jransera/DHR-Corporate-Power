  <h3>
    Introduction
  </h3>
  <p>
    In our current moment, we find the line between the “real” and digital world becoming increasingly blurry. 
    More and more, real, tangible societal outcomes are determined by digital parameters, with little consideration for potential repercussions. 
    The increasing interdependence between the “real” and digital world implies a need to fundamentally question how we conceptualize the structure of our communities and institutions. 
    Throughout history, when we have similarly found ourselves in the midst of this sort of paradigm shift, we return to human rights to anchor our commonly held beliefs. 
    It is for this reason that we must necessarily consider the implications of the digital world on our human rights, at the risk of exploiting the most vulnerable members of our community. 
  </p>
 <p>
   As digital parameters become increasingly important in determining real societal outcomes, it is paramount that we question who and what controls those digital parameters and how that control impacts our human rights.
   In this document, we seek to manage this relationship, protecting the rights of users while also considering how responsible corporations can implement and support those rights.
   But before we can determine how corporations fit within the digital rights space, we must first generally understand how both power and corporate power is generally produced. 
  </p>
  
  <h3>
    What Is Corporate Power?
  </h3>
  <p>
    To systematically consider the role of corporate power in the digital sphere,
    we employ David Birchall’s framework for characterizing corporate power over human rights (2011). 
    In his analytical framework, Birchall begins by defining power, using the language of Michael Barnett and Raymond Duvall:
  <div class="grid2">
  	<h3 class="definition">
    <strong>Power is...</strong>
    </h3>
  	<p class="defText">
      <u>“The production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate”</u>
      -Barnett and Duvall, <i>Power in International Politics</i>
    </p>  
       
  </div>
  </p>
<p>
  From this, Birchall derives his definition of Corporate Power as follows: 
  <div class="grid2">
  	<h3 class="definition2">
    <strong>Corporate Power is...</strong>
    </h3>
  	<p class="defText">
      <u>“The production, by business enterprises, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of individuals to enjoy their human rights.” </u>
      -Barnett and Duvall, <i>Power in International Politics</i>
    </p>       
  </div>
</p>

<p>
  From this definition of corporate power, Birchall identifies 4 areas in which this corporate power is specifically produced:
<strong>the power over individuals, the power over materialities, the power over institutions, and the power over knowledge. 
</strong>
</p>

<p>
  While Birchall’s framework refers to the human rights that are already established in the “real world,” we use Birchall’s framework to consider how these categories and their implied transgressions on human rights shift and transform when transposed onto a digital context.

	<div class="institutions">
      <p>
        The power corporations have over institutions is maintained further once we go online. 
        Yet it is important that we define what these online institutions are. 
        Based on the research we did, we believe the best description of online institutions are
        <strong>1)</strong> Online institutions and the stems that control the internet.
        This means the laws that control the internet and the physical infrastructure that is inplace to run the internet.
        And <strong>2)</strong>governmental institutions that may rely on the internet to function.
        Think of the use of <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/understanding-risk-assessment-instruments-in-criminal-justice/#:~:text=Algorithmic%20tools%20are%20in%20widespread,is%20most%20likely%20to%20occur.">algorithms within the justice system</a>.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        
        Now that we have a clear understanding of what institutions look like online, It might become apparent how corporations can abuse their power.
        Some of the most apparent ideas we came up with were:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/07/isps-spent-235-million-on-lobbying-and-donations-more-than-320000-a-day/">Lobbying to maintain favorable conditions</a></li>
          <li>Framing Damages as merely the Cost of Operation</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.jsonline.com/in-depth/news/2021/07/14/weve-spent-billions-provide-broadband-rural-areas-what-failed-wisconsin/7145014002/">Privatization of Government contracts</a></li>
          <li>Use of algorithms in institutions (justice system, foster care)</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  
    <p>
				While these may already seem bad from a birds eye view,
				we believe that each of these also violate one of the rights either found in the UDHR(Universal Declaration of Human Rights)  or in the proposed in the EDDR (European Declaration of Digital Rights).
				For example, privatization of government contracts  may impede on the
				<u>Right to Free-Will</u>,by not allowing users to choose their providers or services to the fullest extent.
				Or the non-protection against algorithmic biases infringes on an individual’s 
				<u>Right to Non-Discrimination</u>, as seen in our section about the online Individual.

<h3>
  Declaration of Digital Rights Under Corporate Power
  </h3>
  
  <p>
    As we believe that digital rights spawn from the fundamental rights written within the UDHR, we believe that the best basis for our work would be one that focuses on corporate power within this offline space. 
    Thus we chose (insert his first name) Birchall’s 2011 (Check this) Corporate responsibility framework(double check naming convention) as the foundation to our work. 
    In his framework, Birchall states that the definition of power is “The production, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of actors to determine their circumstances and fate”. 
    (insert some analysis or extra sentences here). He continues his definition of Corporate Power as follows: “The production, by business enterprises, in and through social relations, of effects that shape the capacities of individuals to enjoy their human rights.” 
    We can take from this that Corporate Power boils down to how corporations influence and control human rights. (insert some analysis). We have thus taken the framework described by Birchall and have separated it into the following 4 sections.
